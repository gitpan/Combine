Classification modules interfacing with the MPCA Component Analysis system from
http://www.componentanalysis.org/wiki/index.php/Component_Analysis

MPCA preparations:
  1. create a model
  2. start the 'mpserve' and 'ydin' as daemons with approriate
     parameters using your model

The Combine classification modules communicate with the MPCA
system through the network interface provided by 'ydin'.
You have to add a configuration variable 'MPCAHostPort' (in
your job-specific configuration file 'combine.cfg') which
provides the host and port that 'ydin' is set up to use.

  Example:
MPCAHostPort = localhost:10203

The modules provided here need to be in a location where Perl
can find them.
