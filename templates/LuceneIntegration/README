I have wrapped Lucene API in a Java class LuceneIndexer.java and use
it to index xwi object in Lucene.pm. Lucene.pm is similar to Zebra.pm.
In order to use that java class LuceneIndexer.java should be complied
and put under java classpath so our makefile has to be modified.

Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine
library written entirely in Java. It can be found at
   http://lucene.apache.org/

And we also need to add

  " use Inline Java  => 'STUDY',
              STUDY => ['LucenIndexer'];"

in use declarations in bin/combine.

If there are any problems, please let me know.


Best regards,
Xianghang Liu
