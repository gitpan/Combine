\paragraph{DESCRIPTION\label{DESCRIPTION}\index{DESCRIPTION}}


Implements various control functionality to administer a crawling job,

This is the preferred way of controling a crawl job.

\begin{description}

\item[{\texttt{echo 'http://www.yourdomain.com/' $|$ combineCtrl load --jobname aatest}}] \mbox{}

Seed the crawling job \texttt{aatest} with a URL


\item[{\texttt{combineCtrl start --jobname aatest --harvesters 3}}] \mbox{}

Start 3 crawling processes for job \texttt{aatest}


\item[{\texttt{combineCtrl recyclelinks --jobname aatest}}] \mbox{}
