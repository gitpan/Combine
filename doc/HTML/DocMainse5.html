 id="x31-440005.1"></a>Approaches to automated classification</h4>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >According to <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XGolub_Review">7</a>]</span>, one can distinguish between three major approaches to automated
classification: text categorization, document clustering, and string-to-string matching.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Machine learning, or text categorization, is the most widespread approach to automated
classification of text, in which characteristics of pre-defined categories are learnt from
intellectually categorized documents. However, intellectually categorized documents are not
available in many subject areas, for different types of documents or for different user groups. For
example, today the standard text classification benchmark is a Reuters RCV1 collection <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XLewis_etal_04">14</a>]</span>,
which has about 100 classes and 800000 documents. This would imply that for a text
categorization task some 8000 training and testing documents per class are needed. Another
problem is that the algorithm works only for that document collection on which parts it has been
trained. In addition, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XYang_99">20</a>]</span> claims that the most serious problem in text categorization
evaluations is the lack of standard data collections and shows how different versions of
the same collection have a strong impact on performance, whereas other versions do
not.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   In document clustering, the predefined categories (the controlled vocabulary) are
automatically produced: both clusters&#8217; labels and relationships between them are automatically
generated. Labelling of the clusters is a major research problem, with relationships between the
categories, such as those of equivalence, related-term and hierarchical relationships,
being even more difficult to automatically derive (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XSvenonius_2000">18</a>]</span>, p.168). "Automatically-derived
structures often result in heterogeneous criteria for category membership and can be
difficult to understand" <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XChen_Dumais_2000">5</a>]</span>. Also, clusters change as new documents are added to the
collection.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   In string-to-string matching, matching is conducted between a controlled vocabulary and text
of documents to be classified. This approach does not require training documents. Usually
weighting schemes are applied to indicate the degree to which a term from a document to be
classified is significant for the document&#8217;s topicality. The importance of the controlled
vocabularies such as thesauri in automated classification has been recognized in recent research.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XBang_etal_06">4</a>]</span> used a thesaurus to improve performance of the k-NN classifier and managed to improve
precision for about 14 %, without degrading recall. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XMedelyan_06">15</a>]</span> showed how information from a
subject-specific thesaurus improved performance of key-phrase extraction by more than 1,5 times
in F1, precision, and recall. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XGarces_etal_06">6</a>]</span> demonstrated that subject ontologies could help improve word
sense disambiguation.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Thus, the chosen approach to automated subject classification in the crawler was
string-matching. Apart from the fact that no training documents are required, a major
motivation to apply this approach was to re-use the intellectual effort that has gone into creating
such a controlled vocabulary. Vocabulary control in thesauri is achieved in several ways, out of

which the following are beneficial for automated classification:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">the terms are usually noun phrases, which are content words;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">the meaning of the term is restricted to that most effective for the purposes of a
     particular thesaurus, which is indicated by the addition of scope notes and definitions,
     providing additional context for automated classification;
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">three  main  types  of  relationships  are  displayed  in  a  thesaurus:  1)  equivalence
     (synonyms, lexical variants, terms treated as synonyms for general purposes); 2)
     hierarchical (generic, whole-part or instance relationships); 3) associative (terms that
     are closely related conceptually but not hierarchically and are not members of an
     equivalence set).</li></ul>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >In automated classification, equivalence terms allow for discovering the concepts and not just words
expressing them. Hierarchies provide additional context for determining the correct sense of a
term, and so do associative relationships.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x31-450005.1.1"></a>Description of the used string-matching algorithm</h5>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Automated classification approach used for evaluation was string-matching of terms (cf. section
<a 
href="DocMainse4.html#x19-300004.5">4.5<!--tex4ht:ref: autoclass --></a>) from an engineering-specific controlled vocabulary Engineering Index (Ei) thesaurus and
classification scheme, used in Elsevier&#8217;s Compendex database. Ei classification scheme is
organized into six categories which are divided into 38 subjects, which are further subdivided
into 182 specific subject areas. These are further subdivided, resulting in some 800 individual
classes in a five-level hierarchy. In Ei there are on average 88 intellectually selected terms
designating one class.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   The algorithm searches for terms from the Ei thesaurus and classification scheme in
documents to be classified. In order to do this, a term list is created, containing class captions,
different thesauri terms and classes which the terms and captions denote. The term list consists
of triplets: term (single word, Boolean term or phrase), class which the term designates or maps
to, and weight. Boolean terms consist of words that must all be present but in any order or in
any distance from each other. The Boolean terms are not explicitly part of the Ei thesaurus, so
they had to be created in a pre-processing step. They are considered to be those terms
which contain the following strings: &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">and</span></span></span>&#8217;, &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">vs.</span></span></span>&#8217; (short for versus), &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">,</span></span></span>&#8217; (comma), &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">;</span></span></span>&#8217;
(semi-colon, separating different concepts in class names), &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">(</span></span></span>&#8217; (parenthesis, indicating
the context of a homonym), &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">:</span></span></span>&#8217; (colon, indicating a more specific description of the
previous term in a class name), and &#8217;<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="ectt-1095">--</span></span></span>&#8217; (double dash, indicating heading&#8211;subheading
relationship). Upper-case words from the Ei thesaurus and classification scheme are
left in upper case in the term list, assuming that they are acronyms. All other words
containing at least one lower-case letter are converted into lower case. Geographical
names are excluded on the grounds that they are not being engineering-specific in any
sense.

<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >According to <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XInternational_85">1</a>]</span>, intellectually-based subject indexing is a process involving the following three
steps: determining the subject content of the document, conceptual analysis to decide which
aspects of the subject should be represented, and translation of those concepts or
aspects into a controlled vocabulary. These steps are based on the library&#8217;s policy in
respect to their collections and user groups. Thus, when in automated classification
study, the used document collection is the one in which documents have been indexed
intellectually, the policies based on which indexing has been conducted should also
be known, and automated classification should then be based on those policies as
well.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Ei thesaurus and classification scheme is rather big and deep (five hierarchical levels),
allowing many different choices. Without a thorough qualitative analysis of automatically
assigned classes one cannot be sure if, for example, the classes assigned by the algorithm, which
were not intellectually assigned, are actually wrong, or if they were left-out by mistake or
because of the indexing policy.

<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   In addition, subject indexers make errors such as those related to exhaustivity policy (too
many or too few terms get assigned), specificity of indexing (usually this error means that not
the most specific term found was assigned), they may omit important terms, or assign an
obviously incorrect term (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XLancaster_03">13</a>]</span>, p.86-87). In addition, it has been reported that different people,
whether users or subject indexers, would assign different subject terms or classes to the same
document. Studies on inter-indexer and intra-indexer consistency report generally
low indexer consistency (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XOlson_01">16</a>]</span>, p. 99-101). There are two main factors that seem to
affect it: 1) higher exhaustivity and specificity of subject indexing both lead to lower
consistency (indexers choose the same first term for the major subject of the document, but
the consistency decreases as they choose more classes or terms); 2) the bigger the
vocabulary, or, the more choices the indexers have, the less likely they will choose the same
classes or terms (ibid.). Few studies have been conducted as to why indexers disagree
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XHjorland06">2</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   Automated classification experiments today are mostly conducted under controlled
conditions, ignoring the fact that the purpose of automated classification is improved information
retrieval, which should be evaluated in context (cf. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#X1Ingwersen_05">12</a>]</span>). As Sebastiani (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XSebastiani_02">17</a>]</span> p. 32) puts it, &#8220;the
evaluation of document classifiers is typically conducted experimentally, rather than analytically.
The reason is that we would need a formal specification of the problem that the system is trying
to solve (e.g. with respect to what correctness and completeness are defined), and the central
notion that of membership of a document in a category is, due to its subjective character,
inherently nonformalizable&#8221;.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Due to the fact that methodology for such experiments has yet to be developed, as
well as due to limited resources, we follow the traditional approach to evaluation and
start from the assumption that intellectually assigned classes in the data collection
are correct, and the results of automated classification are being compared against
them.

<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Assuming that intellectually assigned classes in the data collection are correct, evaluation in this
study is based on comparison of automatically derived classes against the intellectually
assigned ones. Ei classes are much related to each other and often there is only a
small topical difference between them. The topical relatedness is expressed in numbers
representing the classes: the more initial digits any two classes have in common, the more
related they are. Thus, comparing the classes at only the first few digits instead of all
the five (each representing one hierarchical level), would also make sense. Evaluation
measures used were the standard microaveraged and macroaveraged precision, recall
and F1 measures (<span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >In one study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XGolubRole">9</a>]</span>, it has been explored to what degree different types of terms in Engineering
Index influence automated subject classification performance. Preferred terms, their synonyms,
broader, narrower, related terms, and captions were examined in combination with a stemmer
and a stop-word list. The best performance measured as mean F1 macroaveraged and
microaverage F1 values has the preferred term list, and the worst one the captions list.
Stemming showed to be beneficial in four out of the seven different term lists: captions,
narrower, preferred, and synonyms. Concerning stop words, the mean F1 improved
for narrower and preferred terms. Concerning the number of classes per document
that get automatically assigned, when using captions less than one class is assigned
on average even when stemming is applied; narrower and synonyms improve with
stemming, close to our aim of 2,2 classes that have been intellectually assigned. The
most appropriate number of classes get assigned when preferred terms are used with
stop-words.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   Based on other term types, too many classes get assigned, but that could be dealt with in the
future by introducing cut-offs. Each class is on average designated by 88 terms, ranging from 1 to
756 terms per class. The majority of terms are related terms, followed by synonyms and preferred
terms. By looking at the 10 top-performing classes, it was shown that the sole number
of terms designating a class does not seem to be proportional to the performance.
Moreover, these best performing classes do not have a similar distribution of types of
terms designating them, i.e. the percentage of certain term types does not seem to be
directly related to performance. The same was discovered for the 10 worst-performing
classes.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   In conclusion, the results showed that preferred terms perform best, whereas captions
perform worst. Stemming in most cases showed to improve performance, whereas the stop-word
list did not have a significant impact. The majority of classes is found when using all the terms
and stemming: micro-averaged recall is 73 %. The remaining 27 % of classes were not found
because the words in the term list designating the classes did not exist in the text of the
documents to be classified. This study implies that all types of terms should be used for a term
list in order to achieve best recall, but that higher weights could be given to preferred
terms, captions and synonyms, as the latter yield highest precision. Stemming seems
useful for achieving higher recall, and could be balanced by introducing weights for
stemmed terms. Stop-word list could be applied to captions, narrower and preferred
terms.

 id="x31-520005.3.2"></a>Enriching the term list using natural language processing</h5>
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >In order to allow for better recall, the basic term list was enriched with new terms. From the
basic term list, preferred and synonymous terms were taken, since they give best precision, and
based on them new terms were extracted. These new terms were derived from documents issued
from the Compendex database, using multi-word morpho-syntactic analysis and synonym
acquisition. Multi-word morpho-syntactic analysis was conducted using a unification-based
partial parser FASTER which analyses raw technical texts and, based on built-in meta-rules,
detects morpho-syntactic variants. The parser exploits morphological (derivational and
inflectional) information as given by the database CELEX. Morphological analysis was used to
identify derivational variants (e.g. effect of gravity: gravitational effect), and syntactical analysis
to insert word inside a term (e.g. flow measurement: flow discharge measurements),
permute components of a term (e.g. control of the inventory: inventory control) or
add a coordinated component to a term (e.g. control system: control and navigation
system).
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   Synonyms were acquisited using a rule-based system, SynoTerm which infers synonymy
relations between complex terms by employing semantic information extracted from lexical
resources. Documents were first preprocessed and tagged with part-of-speech information and
lemmatized. Terms were then identified using the term extractor YaTeA based on parsing
patterns and endogenous disambiguation. The semantic information provided by the
database WordNet was used as a bootstrap to acquire synonym terms of the basic
terms.
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   The number of classes that were enriched using these natural language processing methods is
as follows: derivation 705, out of which 93 adjective to noun, 78 noun to adjective, and 534 noun
to verb derivations; permutation 1373; coordination 483; insertion 742; preposition change 69;
synonymy 292 automatically extracted, out of which 168 were manually verified as
correct.
<!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   By combining all the extracted terms into one term list, the mean F1 is 0.14 when stemming
is applied, and microaveraged recall is 0.11. This implies that enriching the original Ei-based
term list should improve recall. In comparison to results we get when gained with the original
term list (micro-averaged recall with stemming 0.73), here the best recall, also microaveraged
and with stemming, is 0.76.

<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >In <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#Xardo05:_ECDL">10</a>]</span> the aim was to determine how significance indicators assigned to different Web page
elements (internal metadata, title, headings, and main text) influence automated classification.
The data collection that was used comprised 1000 Web pages in engineering, to which
Engineering Information classes had been manually assigned. The significance indicators were
derived using several different methods: (total and partial) precision and recall, semantic distance
and multiple regression. It was shown that for best results all the elements have to be included
in the classification process. The exact way of combining the significance indicators
turned out not to be overly important: using the F1 measure, the best combination of
significance indicators yielded no more than 3 % higher performance results than the
baseline.

<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Issues specific to Web pages were identified and discussed in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#XGolubChall">8</a>]</span>. The focus of the study
was a collection of Web pages in the field of engineering. Web pages present a special
challenge: because of their heterogeneity, one principle (e.g. words from headings are more
important than main text) is not applicable to all the Web pages of a collection. For
example, utilizing information from headings on all Web pages might not give improved
results, since headings are sometimes used simply instead of using bold or a bigger font
size.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   A number of weaknesses of the described approach were identified:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-54002x1">Class not found at all, because the words in the term list designating the classes were
     not found in the text of the Web page to be classified.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-54004x2">Class found but below threshold, which has to do with weighting and cut-off values.
     This is because in the approach only classes with scores above a pre-defined cut-off
     value are selected as the classes for the document: the final classes selected are those
     with scores that contain at least 5 % of the sum of all the scores assigned in total, or,
     if such a class doesn&#8217;t exist, the class with the top score is selected. Another reason
     could be that the classification algorithm is made to always pick the most specific
     class as the final one, which is in accordance with the given policy for intellectual
     classification.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-54006x3">Wrong automatically assigned class. Based on the sample, four different sub-problems have
     been identified:
          <ul class="itemize1">
          <li class="itemize">words recognized as homonyms or distant synonyms;
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">word found on a Web page is there because it is an instance of what it represents,
          and it is not about such instances (e.g. a Web page on online tutorials and
          e-learning programs for technical fields gets wrongly classified as a Web page
          on &#8217;education&#8217;);
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">too distant term-class mappings, including cases when one term in the term list
          is mapped to several different classes;
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">words  mentioned  on  the  Web  page  have  little  to  do  with  the  Web  page&#8217;s
          aboutness, e.g. an institution&#8217;s Web page gets wrongly classified as &#8217;facsimile
          systems and technology&#8217;, because among their contact information, there is also
          a fax number, and the word &#8217;fax&#8217; is mapped to that class.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-54008x4">Automatically assigned class that is not really wrong, which probably has to do with the
     subject indexing policy such as exhaustivity.</li></ol>

<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   Ways to deal with those problems were proposed for further research. These include enriching
the term list with synonyms and different word forms, adjusting the term weights and
cut-off values and word-sense disambiguation. In our further research the plan is to
implement automated methods. On the other hand, the suggested manual methods (e.g.
adding synonyms) would, at the same time, improve Ei&#8217;s original function, that of
enhancing retrieval. Having this purpose in mind, manually enriching a controlled
vocabulary for automated classification or indexing would not necessarily create additional
costs.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.3.5   </span> <a 
 id="x31-550005.3.5"></a>Comparing and combining two approaches</h5>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >In <span class="cite">[<a 
href="DocMainli2.html#Xardo06:_ECDL">11</a>]</span> a machine-learning and a string-matching approach to automated subject classification of
text were compared as to their performance on a test collection of six classes. Our first
hypothesis was that, as the string-matching algorithm uses manually constructed model, we
expect it to have higher precision than the machine learning with its automatically constructed
model. On the other hand, while the machine-learning algorithm builds the model from the
training data, we expect it to have higher recall in addition to being more flexible
to changes in the data. Experiments have confirmed the hypothesis only on one of
the six classes. Experimental results showed that SVM on average outperforms the
string-matching algorithm. Different results were gained for different classes. The best results
in string-matching are for class 402, which we attribute to the fact that it has the
highest number of term entries designating it (423). Class 903.3, on the other hand,
has only 26 different term entries designating it in the string-matching term list, but
string-matching largely outperforms SVM in precision (0.97 vs. 0.79). This is subject to further
investigation.
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   The two approaches being complementary, we investigated different combinations of the two
based on combining their vocabularies. The linear SVM in the original setting was trained with
no feature selection except the stop-word removal. Additionally, three experiments were
conducted using feature selection, taking:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55002x1">only the terms that are present in the controlled vocabulary;
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55004x2">the  top  1000  terms  from  centroid  tf-idf  vectors  for  each  class  (terms  that  are
     characteristic for the class - descriptive terms);
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55006x3">the top 1000 terms from the SVM-normal trained on a binary classification problem
     for each class (terms that distinguish one class form the rest distinctive terms).</li></ol>
<!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >   In the experiments with string-matching algorithm, four different term lists were created, and
we report performance for each of them:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55008x1">the original one, based on the controlled vocabulary;
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55010x2">the one based on automatically extracted descriptive keywords from the documents
     belonging to their classes;

     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55012x3">the one based on automatically extracted distinctive keywords from the documents
     belonging to their classes;
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x31-55014x4">the one based on union of the first and the second list.</li></ol>
<!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   SVM performs best using the original set of terms, and string-matching approach also has
best precision when using the original set of terms. Best recall for string-matching is achieved
when using descriptive terms. Reasons for these results need further investigation, including a
larger data collection and combining the two using predictions.
