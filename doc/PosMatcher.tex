This a module in the DESIRE automatic classification system. Copyright 1999.



Exported routines:
1. Fetching text:
   These routines all extract texts from a document (either a Combine record,
   a Combine XWI datastructure or a WWW-page identified by a URL.
   They all return: \$meta, \$head, \$text, \$url, \$title, \$size
        \$meta: Metadata from document
        \$head: Important text from document
        \$text: Plain text from document
        \$url: URL of the document
        \$title: HTML title of the document
        \$size: The size of the document

\begin{verbatim}
   Common input parameters:
        $DoStem: 1=do stemming; 0=no stemming
        $stoplist: object pointer to a LoadTermList object with a stoplist loaded
        $simple: 1=do simple loading; 0=advanced loading (might induce errors)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
  getTextMD5
     parameters: $md5, $hdb_top, $DoStem, $stoplist, $simple
       $md5 is a key into a Combine hdb-directory
       $hdb_top is the path to the top of the Combine hdb-directory
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
 getTextXWI
     parameters: $xwi, $DoStem, $stoplist, $simple
       $xwi is a Combine XWI datastructure
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
 getTextURL
    parameters: $url, $DoStem, $stoplist, $simple
       $url is the URL for the page to extract text from
\end{verbatim}


2. Term matcher
    accepts a text as a (reference) parameter, matches each term in Term against text
    Matches are recorded in an associative array with class as key and summed weight as value.
  Match
    parameters: \$text, \$termlist
       \$text: text to match against the termlist
       \$termlist: object pointer to a LoadTermList object with a termlist loaded
    output: 
       \%score: an associative array with classifications as keys and scores as values



3. Heuristics: sum scores down the classification tree to the leafs
  cleanEiTree
    parameters: \%res - an associative array from Match
    output:     \%res - same array
