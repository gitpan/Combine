\paragraph{SYNOPSIS\label{SYNOPSIS}\index{SYNOPSIS}}


combine --jobname $<$name$>$ --logname $<$id$>$

\paragraph{OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS\label{OPTIONS_AND_ARGUMENTS}\index{OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS}}


jobname is used to find the appropriate configuration (mandatory)



logname is used as identifier in the log (in MySQL table log)

\paragraph{DESCRIPTION\label{DESCRIPTION}\index{DESCRIPTION}}


Does crawling, parsing, optional topic-check and stores in MySQL
database Normally started with the \texttt{combineCtrl} command. Briefly it
get's an URL from the MySQL database, which acts as a common
coordinator for a Combine job. The Web-page is fetched, provided it
passes the robot exclusion protocoll. The HTML ic cleaned using
\texttt{Tidy} and parsed into metadata, headings, text, links and link
achors. Then it is stored (optionaly provided a topic-check is passed
to keep the crawler focused) in the MySQL database in a structured
form.



A simple workflow for a trivial crawl job might look like:

\begin{verbatim}
    Initialize database and configuration
  combineINIT --jobname aatest
    Enter some seed URLs from a file with a list of URLs
  combineCtrl  load --jobname aatest < seedURLs.txt
    Start 2 crawl processes
  combineCtrl  start --jobname aatest --harvesters 2
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
    For some time occasionally schedule new links for crawling
  combineCtrl recyclelinks --jobname aatest
    or look at the size of the ready queue
  combineCtrl stat --jobname aatest
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
    When satisfied kill the crawlers
  combineCtrl kill --jobname aatest
    Export data records in a highly structured XML format
  combineExport --jobname aatest
\end{verbatim}


For more complex jobs you have to edit the job configuration file.
